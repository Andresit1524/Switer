# Switer (a.k.a. SwiterMD)
> *Swift Writing for everyone*

**Switer** (or *SwiterMD* for disambiguation) is a text editor *in development* focused on writing, notes, and PKM (*Personal Knowledge Management*), which aims to stand out for its comfort, power, and simplicity.

## *Planned* main features
- Markdown editor with WYSIWYG editing and preview capabilities
- More capable and dynamic block editing for a smoother experience
- A proprietary Markdown variant designed to be more compatible, elegant, and portable
- Integration with extensions such as LaTeX, Mermaid, embeds, and cross-references
- Maximum performance and speed of use
- Improved design for mobile and desktop devices
- Local-first, no login, just local files on your disk
- Base plugin system and possibility of third-party plugins
- Elegant, clean, and dynamic appearance
- Third-party integrations, synchronization, and better export capabilities

And most importantly: **it does not seek to imitate the mistakes of programs of its kind**. Switer was born from the need for an application that is capable and suitable for everyone, unlike current programs, which are very technical and **incomplete**.

### Philosophy
Switer seeks to comply with the following principles:

1.  **Fast:** in performance thanks to its Svelte + Tauri stack, but also in experience and use.
2.  **Comfortable:** so that writing is a frictionless process, without inconveniences and with the best possible accessibility.
3.  **Elegant:** without discomfort, without half-baked solutions. A space with everything you need with a well-thought-out design.
4.  **Complete:** that each function is in each version. No restricted versions in functions, cuts or limitations.
5.  **Portable:** whether they are portable and multiplatform versions, with export capabilities and access to your notes, Switer is not a form of dependency, but a tool for **your** things.
6.  **Fresh:** without heaviness, bad designs or functionality without aesthetics. Switer seeks to be a beautiful app with what you need.
7.  **Personal:** Switer is yours, and not just because of the MIT license. It seeks the best experience for each user, because **PKM** is **P**ersonal.
8.  **Robust:** with fewer errors, better resilience and optimal solutions.

## Development
Switer is being developed in Svelte-SvelteKit and will be packaged as an app in Tauri when it is ready. To contribute to the code, it is recommended to know these tools and their dependencies.
